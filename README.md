# 🏙️ Bengaluru Urban Analysis — Pollution, Traffic, Population & Land Use (Plotly)

This project presents an interactive visualization of key urban indicators in **Bengaluru**, including **air pollution (PM2.5 and NO₂)**, **traffic congestion**, **population density**, and **land use patterns** across different zones. The visualizations are built using **Plotly Express**, with additional forecasting performed using the **ARIMA** time series model.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

* 📈 **Pollution Trends Over Time**
  Visualizes simulated PM2.5 and NO₂ levels in Bengaluru from 2020 to 2024, showing seasonal patterns.

* 🚦 **Traffic Congestion Analysis**
  Tracks monthly congestion trends and compares average congestion across city zones.

* 🏘️ **Zone-Wise Urban Analysis**
  Includes bar charts for PM2.5 levels, congestion levels, and population density for each zone (Center, North, South, East, West).

* 🔍 **Correlation Study**
  Explores the relationship between traffic congestion and PM2.5 levels using scatter plots.

* 🔮 **Forecasting Air Pollution (PM2.5)**
  Predicts PM2.5 levels for the first half of 2025 using an ARIMA(2,1,2) model.

* 🗺️ **Geospatial Map Visualization**
  Interactive map showing population size (bubble size) and PM2.5 levels (color) across Bengaluru zones using Plotly Mapbox.

* 🧱 **Land Use & Pollution**
  Analyzes how dominant land use types (e.g., Residential, Industrial, Commercial) affect PM2.5 levels.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical computation
* **Plotly Express** – interactive visualizations
* **Statsmodels** – ARIMA time series modeling

## 📂 Data Information

> 📌 **Note:** This project uses **synthetic data** (simulated) for demonstration purposes. No external datasets are loaded from CSV or Excel files.

* Time series data is generated using `numpy` functions to simulate realistic seasonal patterns in pollution and congestion.
* Zone-wise attributes (pollution levels, congestion, population, land use) are manually defined using Python lists.

## 💡 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bengaluru-urban-analysis.git
   cd bengaluru-urban-analysis
   ```

2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy plotly statsmodels
   ```

3. Run the script in any Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   python bengaluru_analysis.py
   ```

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Replace synthetic data with real datasets (e.g., from CPCB, BBMP, OpenStreetMap)
* Add filtering widgets for interactive dashboards
* Integrate machine learning models for classification or clustering of urban zones
